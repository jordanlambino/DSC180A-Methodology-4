**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic I've covered in my domain this quarter was removing invisible watermarks from images. Although this topic is somewhat separate from differential privacy, it helped to understand certain methods of attacking AI watermarks. Reading about this topic offered an alternative perspective to privacy, particularly using simliar mechanisms (Gaussian mechanism) and generative AI for watermark removal.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
